Smart-Spinner TODO-list
=======================

  * Make spinner to be replaced by (ansi-colorized) green check mark at spinner end.
    - Add it (uncolorized) to non-terminal output.

  * Make stopping function accept both true and false boolean values:
    - Make false value to put red failing symbol instead.
    - This is a breaking change, so we must move to 1.0.0 version.
